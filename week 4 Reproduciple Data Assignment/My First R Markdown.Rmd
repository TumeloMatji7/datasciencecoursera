## R Markdown

Hello this is my first R MarkDown the Format, I've Choosen for this file is PDF
Reason being, in the future if i want access any data i have collected it
will be easier to look for . It will also be Good FOr Version control

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
